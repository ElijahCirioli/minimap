Our project, Minimap, is a web based map application that allows users to browse, add, and review markers of useful amenities at locations around the Oregon State University Corvallis campus. These types of markers aren’t shown on popular mapping services like Google Maps, and aren’t tracked on the online Oregon State University campus map, however it’s useful to know about them. For example, vending machines, postal drop boxes, or bike racks.

This project will help inform fellow students and teachers about where certain amenities are on campus. This will help our fellow Beavers live their best lives around campus, especially in parts of campus that they may be unfamiliar with.

As a community project, users will be able to add new markers to the system, review amenities at markers, report errors, and edit location attributes. Of course, users will also be able to scroll around a map showing the markers put down.
